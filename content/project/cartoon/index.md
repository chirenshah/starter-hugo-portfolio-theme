title: Sales Forecasting (Data Analysis and Machine Learning)
date: 2022-09-21T20:59:16.639Z
summary: >-
  * Assembled various Machine Learning and Statistical models like LSTM and
  random forest on a flask server to forecast future sales or trends, with the
  model with the highest performance as determined by the f-1 score being
  chosen.

  * Utilized Time series models with high fidelity to compute short-term accurate forecasts, and regression models with great

    generality, such as CatBoostRegressor, to extrapolate long-term trends.
  * Installed Plotly along with flask to create dynamic graphs with different levels of granularity.
